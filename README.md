Machine Learning for Particle Identification
# How to use  
### 1. creating train data & test data
   
### 2. run input3.py and start learning process
e.g. python3 input3.py 10 30
In this case, tof10ps, energy30% resolution will be used as data.<br>
After the learning process finishes, the input particle_id and output particle_id will be filled into rootfile.

### 3. run normalized_confusion_matrix.py
Get the confusion matrix figure, and you can know the accuracy for each particle
